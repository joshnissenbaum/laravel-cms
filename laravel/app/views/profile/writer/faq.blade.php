        <strong>Q: How long will it take for my post to be reviewed?</strong>

    <div class="panel-body">
        <strong>A:</strong> It can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days for your post to be reviewed. The best way to know when we have reviewed your post is to keep checking the submission center.

        <strong>Q: My article has 'reviewed' on it, now what?</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <strong>A:</strong> Once your post has been reviewed by an administrator it will display in a light blue box and say 'reviewed'. If this has happened, we require additional information from you or would like you to change something about the article before we publish it globally. The administrator who is reviewing your article <strong>will message you</strong>. So keep an eye on your inbox!

        <strong>Q: My article has been declined. Why has this happened?</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <strong>A:</strong> Usually we don't tend to decline articles; we always try to see if the user can provide us with more information, images or videos to make the article better first. If your article has been gone straight to declined then this is for obvious reasons!
